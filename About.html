            <p>
              My interest in computer programming began when I first started
              playing video games. I was fascinated by the process of how games
              were created, which inspired me to start programming in high
              school. Since then, I have been passionate about coding and its
              potential.

            <p>
              During my time in the Game Programming program at Humber, I worked
              on many projects that I was truly proud of. However, I wanted to
              broaden my knowledge of programming, which is why I decided to
              enroll in the Computer Programming program at Humber. I also
              realized the importance of maintaining a healthy balance, so I
              focused on fitness and took up mixed martial arts. It has been a
              great way to stay in shape and effectively manage the stress that
              comes with coding.

            <p>
              As I continue to enhance my programming skills, I aspire to work
              on innovative projects that others can enjoy and benefit from. I
              also plan to expand my knowledge in various areas of computer
              science to create meaningful and engaging experiences.
